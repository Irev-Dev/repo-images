# repo-images
A repo for keeping readme images for my other repos

Images are great for communication and are perfect for readmes but I also don't want to clutter my repos with a images folder with mb of data that has nothing to do with the function of the repo, so they'll go here instead.

There's nothing of note in this repo, you should ignore it.
